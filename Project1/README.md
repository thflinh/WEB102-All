## Notes

- A challenge I encountered was handling image imports with Vite. I resolved it by placing images in the `public` folder and referencing them using relative paths.
- I also needed help styling the layout in a 3x3 grid while keeping the site responsive â€” Flexbox and media queries helped fix this.
